[while]{style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;"} Loops
=======================================================================

For each of these problems, think about what variable controls your
loop, what your initial conditions should be, how the loop control
variable should be updated, and the conditions that cause your loop to
terminate.

1.  **Bug Collector**\
    A bug collector collects bugs every day for fve days. Write a
    program that keeps a running total of the number of bugs collected
    during the fve days. The loop should ask for the number of bugs
    collected for each day, and when the loop is finished, the program
    should display the total number of bugs collected.
2.  **Budget Analysis\
    **Write a program that asks the user to enter the amount that he or
    she has budgeted for a month. A loop should then prompt the user to
    enter each of his or her expenses for the month and keep a running
    total. When the loop fnishes, the program should display the amount
    that the user is over or under budget.
3.  **Distance Traveled**\
    The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as:\
    $$distance = speed \times time$$\
    For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for three hours,
    the distance traveled is 120 miles.\
    Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in
    miles per hour) and the number of hours it has traveled. It should
    then use a loop to display the distance the vehicle has traveled for
    **each hour** of that time period. Here is an example of the desired
    output, where [**bold underline**
    ]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}represents user input:\
    \
    [What is the speed of the vehicle in mph?
    [**40**]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}]{style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;"}\
    [How many hours has it traveled?
    [**3**]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}]{style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;"}\
    [Hour         Distance
    Traveled]{style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;"}\
    [1                  
     40]{style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;"}\
    [2                  
     80]{style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;"}\
    [3                  
    120]{style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;"}
4.  **Pennies for Pay**\
    Write a program that calculates the amount of money a person would
    earn over a period of time if his or her salary is one penny the
    frst day, two pennies the second day, and continues to double each
    day. The program should ask the user for the number of days.\
    Display a table showing what the salary was for each day, then show
    the total pay at the end of the period. The output should be
    displayed in a **dollar amount**, not the number of pennies
5.  **Sum of Numbers**\
    Write a program with a loop that asks the user to enter a series of
    positive numbers. The user should enter a negative number to signal
    the end of the series. After all the positive numbers have been
    entered, the program should display their sum,
6.  **Ocean Levels**\
    Assuming the ocean's level is currently rising at about 1.6
    millimeters per year, create an application that displays the number
    of millimeters that the ocean will have risen each year for the next
    25 years.
7.  **Tuition Increase**\
    At one college, the tuition for a full-time student is \$8,000 per
    semester. It has been announced that the tuition will increase by 3
    percent each year for the next 5 years. Write a program with a loop
    that displays the projected semester tuition amount for the next 5
    years.
8.  **Calculating the Factorial of a Number**\
    In mathematics, the notation n! represents the factorial of the
    nonnegative integer n. The factorial of n is the product of all the
    nonnegative integers from 1 to n. For example:\
    $$7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040$$\
    and\
    $$4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24$$\
    Write a program that lets the user enter a **nonnegative integer**
    then uses a loop to calculate the factorial of that number. Display
    the factorial.
